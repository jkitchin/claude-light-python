#+title: Claude Light python interface

See https://github.com/jkitchin/claude-light?tab=readme-ov-file#Usage for details about Claude Light. This library provides a Python interface to that instrument that is designed for use in Jupyter notebooks (although scripts work too).

This interface provides a variety of virtual interfaces to Claude Light. There is an introductory instrument with one input/output, one for one input / many outputs, many inputs / many outputs, and a general purpose instrument you can use to get all the data possible.
